        <p class="page-title-block__intro-block">
            One of the most recognizable brands in the antivirus industry, Norton have been in the game since 1991. In the first half of 2007, Norton held a 61% market share of antivirus / security suite products, making them the household name in PC protection. Despite their success in the market, they have been subject to a lot of criticism in the media ­ as you can imagine, through being such a high profile name and having a widely used piece of software, any blunders from Norton results in mass upset.

Norton is infamous for it’s convoluted uninstall process, their removal tool only removing certain aspects of the product and leaving others, but should this affect your choice when deciding on an Antivirus software?        </p>

            <h4 class="space-below space-below--medium">Reliability and Security</h4>

            <p class="space-below space-below--xxxlarge">Given Norton’s experience in the antivirus / PC security arena, you should expect a quality malware removal tool with little-to-no hitches in performance. (A slip from such important software can mean the end of your PC) 

Unfortunately, expectations don’t necessarily match up to reality with Norton’s antivirus product. In antivirus tests, Norton’s antivirus all to often picks up completely docile software as dangerous. In a usage case, this means that the software may flag up your pre-existing, completely safe software as a threat to your safety, rendering the otherwise harmless software unusable. (If you follow the software’s advice and quarantine it) </p>

            <h4 class="space-below space-below--medium">Support and Customer Service</h4>

            <p class="space-below space-below--xxxlarge">Norton are often shamed for their customer support, with many reported cases of Norton ‘security experts’ telling users their computers are infected and need to be fixed. Of course, there never was an infection and the security experts charge the user a fee for it to be ‘fixed’. 

We never felt so much as ‘conned’ by Norton support, but there we certainly weren’t impressed by it. Getting to a point where you can speak to a human at Norton for help isn’t as easy as it should be, your best bet is searching Google for the ‘Contact Us’ page. When you do reach it, you are offered ‘Live Chat’ support, which is a great way of offering and receiving support in the antivirus market. As well as live chat, Norton offer support over the phone. Annoyingly however, you have to fill out a form to get a number to call.

In situations whereby you require support, you are likely to already be disgruntled. If you then had to peruse their website just to find a way of contacting them, it would annoy you even more. Consider this when making your decision on Norton.

                                        Stay Away from NORTON!!!!  Program package is problematic and their tech support is based in India. After several interactions with Norton Technical Services, I found that their tech staff is in INDIA and has no clue to TCP/IP and CIDR notation. My experience started with an inquiry to why they are using XEROX and MICROSOFT ARIN registered TCP/IP and especially keeping certain ports and windsocks open from power up to power down. I explained that this was a security flaw but Tech Support wanted to remote into my device. (NEVER LET ANYONE REMOTE INTO YOUR DEVICE UNLESS YOU TRUST THEM EXPLICITLY)! Working in the IOT world as an engineer for 35 years I took that chance and observed that the INDIA support specialist had no clue what he was doing and I had to correct his attempts to block ports by CIDR range instead of single address. He could not tell me why Nortonsecurity.exe was holding a Winsock open on port 80 and the TCP/IP was registered to XEROX and others to Microsoft. 
Hypothetical - what if the US suddenly had conflict with India or mid-eastern countries. They would have access to everyone’s computer / device silently without permission to remote in because their remote software is built into their main Antivirus program. That makes my stomach sour...  Norton advertises they have US based tech support but it is a lie. I am tired of picking up the phone only to hear an undisputed mid-eastern accent and after inquiring they confess they are from the Mideast. I gave Norton a chance years ago and found that they rewrote critical system .DLL files and made almost impossible to uninstall there software, Now with the latest find of a security company that blatantly practices anti-secure practices and a staff supporting their product that has NO Computer knowledge made me think that I will never trust or go back to Norton again. And recently they teamed up with Life lock will surely cause many people to suffer future events down the road. Head the warning - DO NOT TRUST NORTON!!!

                                        I have been using Norton for many years, but now Norton is selling their product bits by bits. When I inquired about it and spoke to the Norton representative they are giving me ambiguous answers. I had to cancel my automatic renewal subscription.                                         </p>

                                        Basically, in a nut shell, Nortons is a virus in itself, disguised as an antivirus. Slowed the operating system on three networked computers down that much it was ridiculous and updates seemed to take priority over everything.
Embedded itself deep within the operating system including network and was both time consuming and a nightmare to try and clear out.                                    </p>

                                        Norton tried to transfer $500.00 on 03 August '17 from  my account into what they call 'Coin Base' without my knowledge.  I had a feeling something was wrong, called my Credit Card Company, they confirmed the above.  I then cancelled my CARD, and do not ever want to deal with them again. Unfortunately they still have $149.00 of my money, and I have 362 days left with this ASININE Company.  THEY SUCK!                                    </p>

                                        Keeps wanting to delete programs I have been using for over 15 years. It does not offer for user to select an override!!! Very poor!
An email to Norton was ignored. One program I have to reenter the key for. Have not been able to identify the Norton process that causes that. Do not have this problems with computers that I do not use Norton on!!!                                    </p>

                                        Yeah, they tried to suck me in too with "you have a virus" when i tried to enter my product key for a new download, when i entered the key, it said-error code, so i called the number on the page and guess what, it had nothing to do with Norton,some call centre in the middle of India(i suspect) 
Thinking they were from Norton, i allowed them remote access(big mistake) and that's when they fabricated things.
They said i had problems and they would sort it out for me and install the Antivirus for a sum of $220.00 and that when the alarm bell started to ring, i was a little suss because both my computers had an error message, one i was running on windows x
So i said no thanks and hung up, be careful when down loading from these sites, i finally got the proper phone number from Office Works when i explained what happened and spoke to a Norton representative who guided me all the way without a hitch and they don't charge for the support.
Be aware!!!

                                        I subscribed for several years because of high rating and reasonable price for multiple computers. But on two different computers it suddenly told me one day that I had an expired trial version (which was incorrect). Eventually after more than an hour with tech support in each instance they got it straightened out. But I shouldn't have to spend several hours of MY time to fix THEIR software bug. I WILL NOT support any software that is willing to do that. They didn't even often a discount or extension of service as a way of apologizing. And then they have the gall to keep sending me notices asking me to resubscribe. After THAT. NO WAY!                                    </p>

                                        I have Norton 360 Premier. I also have MyWay infecting my laptop, just like Ask used to do. I can't understand why Norton didn't block the nasty irritating uninvited interloper. Try to do a Google search and get MyWay with all its useless information and advertising touting for business instead. Hate it! Thanks for nothing.                                    </p>
